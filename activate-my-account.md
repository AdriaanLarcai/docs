* The **Activate User** page can be used to activate an account if for any reason the activation link can’t be used to activate a users account

## Required details

* The unique **Username/E-mail** **Address** that the user registered with
* The **Activation Token** that you received with your registration e-mail

## Troubleshooting

**If you can’t activate an AIForged Account check the following**

* Make sure that your **Device** is connected to the **Internet**.
* If you are using AiForged on an internal network check with your administrators that the **Identity Server Url** and **Service Endpoint Url** are allowed through your network these can be found in the [**Settings**](settings.md) of the application.
* If you have your own internal **AIForged Services** running add the **Endpoints** to the **Services** page.
* Check if your registration email is not in your **junk** or **spam** folder
