you can identify 3 main categories: structured, semi-structured, and unstructured. Each type of document comes with its own set of challenges.

### Structured documents

Structured documents generally focus on collecting information in a precise format, guiding the person who is filling them with precise areas where each piece of data needs to be entered.

### Semi-structured

Semi-structured documents are documents that do not follow a strict format the way structured forms do and are not bound to specified data fields. These don't have a fixed form but follow a common format.

#### Unstructured

Unstructured documents are documents in which the information isn't organized according to a clear, structured model.
