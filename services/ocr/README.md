**Optical Character Recognition** is the electronic conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo or from subtitle text superimposed on an image.

**OCR** is currently a heavily competitive application area in **Information Technology**, with most of the **Tech Giants**, such as **Google**, **Microsoft**, and **Amazon**, to name a few, constantly competing against each other to provide top-notch **Cloud Based** implementations for **OCR Services**.

**AIForged** extends its operations and functionality by harnessing the power of these OCR solutions. Currently, a series of external **OCR Services** are incorporated by **AIForged**:
