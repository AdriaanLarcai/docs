### Project Cards

Project cards in AIForged Studio provide concise summaries of each project.&#x20;

They serve as quick-access points within AIForged Studio, offering essential information about each project at a glance. They typically include:

* **Project Name**: Clearly identifies the project.
* **Summary Information**: Provides key details such as project description or relevant metadata.
