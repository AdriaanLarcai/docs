* The Register page is used to Register a new AIForged account. Your new account can be linked up to an [External Login](login.md) at a later stage.
* If you already own a listed **Social Media** or **Azure AD account**, you can login via the [External Login](login.md) section of the login page, which will automatically register a new account based on your existing external details.

## Required details

* A unique **Username** that has not been previously registered with the AIForged platform
* A unique **E-mail address** that has not been previously registered with the AIForged platform
* Your **full name**
* Your contact **telephone number**
* A secure **password**

## Troubleshooting

**If you are unable to register a new AIForged Account please check the following**

* Ensure that your **Device** is connected to the **Internet**.
* If you are using AIForged on a business or enterprise network, please check with your network administrators that the AIForged **Service Endpoint URL** is allowed outbound access via your network. This URL can be found in the [**Settings**](settings.md) section of the AIForged Studio.
* If you have deployed AIForged on-premises, please make sure to add the correct **Service Endpoint URL** in the [**Settings**](settings.md) section of the AIForged Studio.
* Ensure that your password matches in both the **Password** and **Confirm Password** sections of the registration page and that you have passed the **reCAPTCHA** verification.
