# Projects

The **Projects** page displays all of your accessible projects in a grid of **Project Cards**.\
Each **Project Card** displays a summary of each [**Service**](https://github.com/aiforged/docs/blob/master/broken-reference/README.md) contained within each respective project, as well as the total number of processed [**Documents**](https://github.com/aiforged/docs/blob/master/broken-reference/README.md) and the remaining credit balance for that project.

Clicking on a [**Service**](https://github.com/aiforged/docs/blob/master/broken-reference/README.md) icon within a **Project Card** allows you to zoom to that service.

Clicking a **Project Card** will open the project detail view.

The **Projects** page is opened by default when the AIForged Studio is first opened, and can also be opened by selecting the **Projects** navigation item in the main navigation menu.
