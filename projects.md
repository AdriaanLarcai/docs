The **Projects** page displays projects created by you, or that have been shared with you, and allows you to create a new project at any time. Each **Project Card** displays a summary of each [**Service**](broken-reference/) contained within each respective project, as well as the total number of processed [**Documents**](broken-reference/) and the remaining credit balance for that project.

Clicking on a [**Service**](broken-reference/) icon allows you to zoom to that service.

Clicking the project card will open the project detail view.
